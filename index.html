<!--Welcome to "Projects Fuego..." Just follow along with comments like this one, and you'll design a really cool webtext that not only introduces you, your skills, and interests to the rest of the class, but also builds your coding literacy. Refer to the repository README for GitHub publishing help.-->

<!--BTW. You can leave these faded code comments be, or delete them. Programmers and web designers use these comments to better explain what the code is doing for others who may enter the document later. They are but road signs, absent from the larger design-->

<!--HTML pages start by calling <!DOCTYPE html> and designating a language.-->
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
  <!--Next comes the <head> information including the title and all of the important links that make the webtext work. When a browser access your url, it looks first at the index.html document <head> to learn about the names and locations of the other files and assets it will need to assemble your code into a visual display.-->

  <!--Go ahead and fill in the blank in <title>I am...</title> (see just below). The <title> will appear in your document's browser tab-->
<title>I am...</title>
<!--The stuff below the title does important work to tell browsers what this page should look like on different screens-->
<meta charset="UTF-8">
<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1">
<!--Next is a link to the cascading style sheet or CSS. Web designers use a cascading stylesheet CSS to add styling to a website. Designers do this by "calling" a <div class> in HTML and defining the class attributes on the style sheet. Doing so saves time and results in less code. On the style.css page you'll find attributes relating font, text size, image size, among other details.-->
<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="style.css">
</head>


<body>
<!--Now we will start working in the body of the document. The body holds all of the code and content that will appear as a visual for our audience.-->

<!--Designers refer to this next section as a "Hero Image." The hero image is styled on the style.css page by calling a "class." To replace the hero image, simply place a .jpg file in the same file folder (directory) as this project and name it "hero.jpg." Alternatively, if you are working with a .png, you will need to open the style.css file using your text editor, find the "hero-image" class and change the file type from ".jpg" to ".png."" Browsers will only work with .jpg, .jpeg, or .png images. Since hero images need to stretch across the screen, typically you will want to select an image 1200px in width to allow quick load time yet avoid pixilation.-->

  <h2>Field of Study</h2>
  <h3>I am a Junior pursuing a Public and Professional Writing Degree and looking to add a Creative Writing Minor. This is a far cry from my previous Political Science major! I've always known I needed to have writing in my daily life, and I have finally become comfortable with the idea that I don't need to know exactly what field of writing I will dedicate my life to just yet, so I'm focusing on becoming the best writer I can be through this major.</h3>

  <h2>Knowledge, Tools, and Skills</h2>
    <h3>As mentioned, I'm an avid writer. Being in PPW, I have learned a lot about rhetoric and how to use writing--including the formats of different genres- to persuade audiences. In a few of my classes, we have explored how to incorporate visual works like infographics into our writing; in one class we created a newsletter on the platform Substack, which included desiging a logo, various visual pieces, and website themes. As far as graphic design goes, while it's not exactly the same, I used to do studio editing as a hobby. I used the video editing software Sony Vegas Pro and have a little experience with Adobe After Effects. After becoming immersed in a combination of these things, I realized that one of my favorite parts of publishing my writing was creating visual elements to go along with it. I loved desiging backgrounds and profile pictures for my friends and logos for my own blogs. Academically, I enjoy creating power point presentations, animations, or infographics; I really love the graphic design element. Below are a few examples of things I have created both in and out of school! </h3>

<!--So, what exactly is good design? Take some time to explain your design interests...defining it, providing examples, explaining why is it important/significant-->
<div class="textblock" style="text-align: center">
  <h2>What is good design?</h2>
      <h3> In my opinion, a good design is well-communicated, clean and clear, recognizable, cohesive/coordinated, and intentional. I am partial to very clean-cut, sleek designs that clearly communicates the desired information, as well as strong color schemes. If a design isn't visually appealing, it loses influence. A good design must be understandable, otherwise it loses its purpose and connection to the audience. Although great art can come from extremely abstract ideas, I believe a good design in the context of this course is well thought-out and mindfully created to represent information.Below are a few logos and album covers that I think are really incredible examples of design. </h3>
